this program works on the probability of independent event on dice roll.
Say that we have a dice and we bet that a number K, would occur on its face.
In the two roll of dice.
we will have the sample space.
{1,2,3,4,5,6}, {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

though the chances of winning appears to be 1/2, but its not!!

lets look at the favourable outcome taking the k as one
{1,1},{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{1,5},{1,6}
{2,1}
{3,1}
{4,1}
{5,1}
{6,1}

and the total possible outcomes are: 36.
favourable outcomes:11.

probability=11/36= 0.30 which is less than 0.33.
this is what is the logic behind the dice roll gamble which can be frequently seen in village fairs around india.
